# CI

Starforge CI is opt-in per repository. A repository with no
`.starforge/ci.toml` behaves exactly as before: external CI keeps
reporting through the commit-status API and webhooks (`POST
/repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{sha}`). When you add the spec below, a
registered runner claims each job, runs it in a sandbox, streams logs,
and writes one check per job named `ci/<job-name>` — which gates can
require, exactly like an external CI context.

## Writing `.starforge/ci.toml`

The spec is read from the commit tree of the repository (never the
working tree), so every commit carries the CI definition it runs with.
A malformed spec fails the run with a `ci/spec` check `error` and a clear
description. The file is at most 256 KiB, holds at most 100 jobs, and
every key must be known — unknown fields are rejected.

```toml
version = 1

[triggers]
push = ["main", "release/*"]
trail = ["opened", "updated"]

[[job]]
name = "test"
image = "docker.io/library/rust:1.85"
commands = ["cargo test --workspace"]
timeout = "30m"
env = { RUST_BACKTRACE = "1" }
secrets = ["CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN"]
artifacts = ["target/nextest/**"]
runs_on = ["linux"]
```

- `version` must be `1`.
- `[triggers] push` takes branch globs (`main`, `release/*`); `trail`
  takes `opened` and/or `updated` for Trail changes. Omit a section to
  disable that trigger.
- `[[job]]` (the singular `job` key is an accepted alias) defines one
  job. `name` must be unique in the file. Exactly one of `image` /
  `template` names what runs: an image reference
  (`docker.io/library/rust:1.85`) or a template name
  (`starforge/rust`). The local sandbox daemon only runs images on its
  operator-configured allowlist.
- `commands` is a non-empty list of shell commands, run in order in the
  sandbox at `/workspace`.
- `timeout` is `90s`, `30m`, `1h`, or bare seconds; the default is 1
  hour and the maximum is 4 hours. It counts from the moment a runner
  claims the job, so time spent waiting for a runner does not count; a
  job still running past it fails with `the job exceeded its timeout`.
- `env` injects plain environment variables into the job.
- `secrets` lists secret **names** (never values) for the job. Delivery
  is wired (see [Secrets](#secrets)): a missing or forbidden name
  resolves nothing and is not an error.
- `artifacts` lists globs for files the runner harvests on completion:
  relative paths only, no `..`; each artifact upload is capped at 1 GiB.
- `runs_on` lists runner labels that may claim the job (empty means any
  runner for the repo).
- `matrix` expands one job into one job per combination of its values
  (see [Matrix](#matrix)).

No host mounts, privileged containers, or arbitrary devices are
expressible — a job only ever runs inside its sandbox.

### Matrix

A job can expand into several jobs with `[job.matrix]`:

```toml
[[job]]
name = "test"
image = "docker.io/library/rust:1.85"
commands = ["cargo test"]
[job.matrix]
os = ["linux", "mac"]
rust = ["1.85", "1.90"]
```

This enqueues four jobs. Each expanded job has `os` and `rust` in its
environment and a name like `test-0-os-linux-rust-1-85`. The check
context is `ci/<expanded-name>`. A gate can require one combination or
the base job's combinations. A manual run with `--job test` enqueues
every combination of `test` (never a different job such as
`test-fast`). The spec allows at most 8 keys, 16 values per key, 64
expanded jobs per job, and 256 jobs after expansion in the whole file.

## Triggers

A push to a matching branch, a Trail change opened/updated, or a manual
trigger enqueues the jobs at that commit. One run per `(repo, commit,
job)`: re-triggering the same commit does not duplicate a queued or
running job. A new Trail revision supersedes the change's older active
jobs (queued/claimed/running jobs of older revisions are canceled);
pushes do not. The triggering user (pusher / Trail author / manual
caller) is recorded as the job's creator.

```shell
# Manual trigger (repo:write, at least Write)
curl -X POST "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/runs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ref": "main"}'

# List runs and get one run's detail (logs, artifacts, sessions)
curl "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/runs?limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/runs/$JOB_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Request cancellation
curl -X POST "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/runs/$JOB_ID/cancel" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Each run writes a `ci/<job-name>` commit status (`pending` at enqueue,
`success` / `failure` / `error` at the end; a canceled job writes
`error` with description `canceled by <user>`) and emits the `ci`
webhook event, so gates and hooks react to native CI the same way they
react to external CI.

## Runners

A runner is a machine the repo admin registers (see
[Admin: CI](../admin/ci.md)). Jobs only run when a runner whose labels
match `runs_on` is online; otherwise they stay queued. The runner
itself is what an agent session inside a job uploads with: the agent
runs in the sandbox image (`packaging/sandbox/`), and
The runner puts the per-job token in `STARFORGE_TOKEN` and sets the
`starforge.server` / `starforge.repo` git config, so `starforge sync`
there needs no interactive login and no long-lived PAT. The session
appears on the commit / Trail / run page. The egress proxy forwards
HTTPS `CONNECT` only, so use an `https://` server and repo URL; a plain
`http://` origin or a non-443 port is not proxied.

## Cache

A job can keep a dependency cache between runs:

```toml
[job.cache]
key = "cargo-1.85"
paths = ["target", ".cargo/registry"]
restore_keys = ["cargo-"]
```

The runner restores the entry before the commands and saves it after a
successful job. The exact key wins; `restore_keys` are prefixes tried in
order. Entries are scoped to the job's branch: a job reads its own
branch's entry, then the default branch's, and writes only its own.
Paths are relative to the checkout root. An entry is at most
256 MiB, is retained 7 days, and the repository keeps at most 50 live
entries (the least recently used entry is evicted first). A cache failure
does not fail the job.

## Run locally

`starforge ci run` parses `.starforge/ci.toml` and runs the jobs in a
local sandbox, without a server or a CI job. It needs a running
`starforge-sandboxd` and a container image. The working tree is copied
into the sandbox.

```sh
starforge ci run
starforge ci run --job test
starforge ci run --keep
```

`--job NAME` runs one job. An exact expanded name runs one combination.
Without `--job`, every expanded job runs in order. The command stops at
the first failure and exits with that job's code. The sandbox is killed
after each job unless `--keep` is set. Secrets are not resolved locally.
A job that lists `secrets` runs without them. The copy respects
`.gitignore` and includes `.git`. The archive caps at 512 MiB. Local runs
ignore `[job.cache]` and `artifacts`. Network is off unless `--allow-host`
names a host.

## Artifacts

Files matching a job's `artifacts` globs are uploaded after a
successful run (authorize-then-PUT, download authenticated). Artifacts
expire after 30 days; an expired artifact can no longer be downloaded.
Expired artifacts are deleted by the hourly cleanup. Artifact names
must be relative and stay inside the workspace.

## Secrets

Repo secrets are created and rotated by repo admins (at least Admin).
In the web UI, open the repository's **CI secrets** settings page
(`/{owner}/{repo}/settings/ci-secrets`): it lists each secret's name,
proxy host and header, redaction flag, and timestamps; it adds or rotates
a secret and deletes one. A rotate with blank Host and Header keeps the
existing proxy binding. Values stay write-only there, exactly as with the
API below.
```shell
curl -X POST "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/secrets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN", "value": "…", "host": "crates.io", "header": "Authorization"}'
curl "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/secrets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -X DELETE "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/secrets/CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Values are sealed (XChaCha20-Poly1305) and never stored or logged in
plaintext; the spec carries names only. Secrets resolve only for runs
on protected branches or approved Trails; `refs/for` runs get none
unless the repository opts in (see below). A missing or forbidden
name resolves nothing and is not an error.

Each secret accepts optional `host` and `header` fields on create.
`host` is an exact DNS name (lowercase, no scheme, port, or wildcard);
`header` is a safe request header (hop-by-hop names are rejected).
`host` defaults to empty and `header` defaults to `Authorization`.
List and resolve responses include both fields. A secret with an
empty host is not proxy-injected; it still registers for session
redaction. Values never enter the sandbox environment or filesystem
on the local provider — the egress proxy injects them as headers for
the bound host only. A secret's value is registered for dynamic
redaction in the job's sessions, so it cannot appear in session text,
logs, or search results.

A repository Admin sets the per-repository secret policy with
`PATCH /api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}`:

```shell
curl -X PATCH "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ci_allow_secrets_on_refs_for": true, "ci_env_secrets": false}'
```

Both fields default to off. `ci_allow_secrets_on_refs_for` lets
`refs/for` runs resolve secrets. `ci_env_secrets` is an E2B-only
opt-in: with it on, the E2B provider injects the values as
environment variables instead of through the proxy. Delivery is
wired: the runner resolves a job's secrets after its git credential,
adds the values to its log-scrub list, and the server resolves secrets
for a job-token sandbox create and passes the bindings to the local
daemon, which injects only for the named host and header.

## Usage and quotas

Who meters CI usage and enforces its limits depends on who runs the
compute:

- **Native runners** (registered with Starforge): Starforge meters each
  job attempt's runner time and the repository's unexpired artifacts. The
  server operator may set quotas (`[ci.limits]`): when the month's runner
  minutes are used up, new runs are not queued and the job's `ci/<job>`
  check says why and when the quota resets (an existing check on that
  commit is left as it is); an artifact upload past the storage quota is
  refused. The minutes quota is best-effort: an attempt's minutes count
  when it ends, so runs already queued or running when it fills still
  finish and count toward it.
- **Depot**: a repository admin links the repository to its name in
  Depot (`owner/name`). Starforge then reads that repository's usage from
  Depot's API. Depot's plan allowances and usage caps apply and are
  enforced by Depot; Starforge does not limit Depot work.

```shell
# This month's usage per supplier (at least Maintain)
curl "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/usage" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Link (or relink) the repository to Depot (at least Admin)
curl -X PUT "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/suppliers/depot" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"external_ref": "acme/app"}'

# Unlink
curl -X DELETE "$SERVER/api/v1/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/ci/suppliers/depot" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Each supplier's report lists metrics with `used` and, when Starforge
enforces one, `limit`; `enforced_by` says who enforces the limits.
Native metrics are `runner_minutes`, `attempts`, and `artifact_bytes`;
Depot metrics are `depot_ci_vcpu_minutes`, `depot_ci_minutes`,
`depot_ci_attempts`, `github_actions_minutes`, and `github_actions_jobs`
for the linked repository. If Depot cannot be reached, its report carries
an `error` and the native report is unaffected. Maintainers also see the
report on the repository's CI page (**Usage this month**).

The normative spec — limits, run states, check descriptions, and the
`ci`/`check` webhook payloads — is [CI Format v1](../format/ci-v1.md).

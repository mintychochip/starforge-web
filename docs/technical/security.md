# Security

## Purpose

> **Note:** This page describes trust boundaries and security controls.
> For setup procedures, read the administration guide in `docs/admin`.

This page describes the trust boundaries Starforge enforces.
It describes authentication, authorization, web defenses, and outbound request rules.
It addresses operators and developers who maintain the server.
The page links runtime limits to the operations page at [operations.md](operations.md).

## Scope

This page covers browser, API, git, agent output, mirror, and webhook boundaries.
It covers passwords, one time codes, single sign on, tokens, and SSH keys.
It covers permission levels, web defenses, SSRF rules, and push defenses.
It covers secrets at rest, audit reads, and known limits.

## Design

### Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Default stance |
|---|---|
| Browser and web session | Untrusted until templates escape output |
| API client and token | Untrusted until scope and rate checks pass |
| Git client through SSH or smart HTTP | Untrusted until `git_access` grants access |
| Agent output and session traces | Untrusted text until redaction and quarantine run |
| Mirror upstream | Untrusted until URL and SSRF checks pass |
| Webhook receiver | Untrusted until the SSRF gate allows delivery |
| CI runner | Untrusted until the runner token and the lease fence pass |
| CI job execution | Untrusted until the job token stays live and the fence matches |
| Sandbox workload | Untrusted until isolation and the egress allowlist constrain it |

- The server treats browser input as untrusted until templates escape output.
- The server treats agent output as untrusted until redaction and quarantine run.
- The server treats mirror upstreams as untrusted until URL and SSRF checks pass.
- Webhook delivery is fail closed when the SSRF gate denies a host.

### Authentication

- The server hashes passwords with Argon2 through `hash_password` in `accounts.rs`.
- Only the password hash reaches the database.
- A one time secret holds 20 bytes and rests in sealed form.
- Current code never logs the sealed TOTP secret.
- The server verifies time based codes with HMAC SHA1 across one step either way.
- The server refuses a code step twice through `totp_last_step`.
- Recovery codes rest as normalized SHA256 hashes.
- A challenge expires after five minutes. Five failed codes void it earlier.
- Single sign on uses the authorization code flow with PKCE.
- The PKCE method is S256.
- The server accepts only RS256 and ES256 identity tokens.
- The server checks issuer, audience, expiry, and nonce on each token.
- The server requires HTTPS for the issuer except on loopback hosts. Production builds accept loopback HTTP.
- Discovery rests in cache for one hour.
- The server caches JSON Web Key Set entries by `kid` and refreshes once on unknown `kid`.
- The `client_secret` field redacts in `Debug` output.
- Device flow accepts only client `starforge-cli`.
- The server stores only a hash of each device code.
- Device codes expire after 900 seconds.
- The server answers `slow_down` for a faster poll.
- Access tokens live 3600 seconds and refresh tokens live 90 days.
- A transaction compare and swap mints a token pair once.
- The server rejects an unknown client identifier outright.

| Item | Format |
|---|---|
| Personal access token | `sfp_` plus 64 hex characters |
| Device user code | `XXXX-XXXX` in Crockford form |
| Sign on callback | `<base_url>/login/oidc/callback` |
| Device verification site | `/oauth/device?user_code=` |

- The server shows a personal access token once at creation.
- Only the SHA256 hash of the token reaches the database.
- Invite links expire after 7 days.
- Invite links are single use and release on a failed sign up.
- Registration modes are `invite`, `open`, `domains`, and `sso`.

| Scope | Grant |
|---|---|
| `repo:read` | Read repository content |
| `repo:write` | Write repository content |
| `trail:write` | Change Trail content |
| `session:upload` | Upload session segments |
| `sandbox:run` | Run sandboxes for a repository |
| `admin` | Full site administration |

- `repo:write` implies `repo:read`.
- `admin` implies every scope.
- The SSH server accepts public key authentication only.
- The SSH username must be `git`.
- The SSH server allows at most 3 authentication attempts.
- Accepted algorithms are `ssh-ed25519`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`, and `ssh-rsa`.
- RSA moduli must hold at least 2048 bits.
- The server rejects certificate keys.
- The server rejects options prefixes and multiple keys on one line.
- A fingerprint is unique across user keys and deploy keys.
- The server holds at most 100 user keys and 50 deploy keys per repository.

### Authorization model

- Permission levels in order are `Read`, `Triage`, `Write`, `Maintain`, and `Admin`.
- Visibility levels in order are `Public`, `Internal`, and `Private`.
- The `effective` function resolves one permission per caller.
- An owner resolves to `Admin`.
- A site admin resolves to `Admin`.
- Other callers take the maximum of organization base, team grants, and collaborator grants.
- Public repositories grant implicit read to anonymous callers.
- Internal repositories grant implicit read to signed in callers only.
- A member holds an explicit grant.
- A site admin alone is not a member.
- Implicit read is not membership.
- Deploy keys grant `Read` or `Write` and never `refs/for` access.
- Checkpoint refs need write tier and a `repo:write` or `session:upload` token. Public repositories refuse checkpoint refs, because every reader can fetch an unpublished session's working tree. The CLI keeps those checkpoints local. The metadata route also refuses an unpublished session on a public repository.
- The admin pages answer 404 to non admin callers.
- The server refuses to suspend or delete the caller. The server allows self-demotion unless the caller is the last active admin.
- The server refuses to suspend, delete, or demote the last active admin.
- Session publication follows the publish and quarantine rules in [trace-and-redaction.md](trace-and-redaction.md).

### Web defenses

- State changing forms check a CSRF token against the web session.
- Signed out forms check a token against the `sf_login_csrf` cookie.
- Pages carry a strict content security policy without nonces.
- User text reaches templates only through escaping.
- Markdown rendering disables raw HTML and then cleans output through `ammonia`.
- Relative links in repository documents resolve to local blob, tree, or raw pages. Absolute links stay unchanged. Ammonia strips `javascript:` targets.
- Responses carry `nosniff` for content type handling.
- Change and search pages carry `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.
- Cookies are `HttpOnly` with `SameSite=Lax`.
- Cookies gain `Secure` when `server.base_url` starts with `https://`.
- Redirect targets must start with one slash.
- Redirect targets reject backslash and control characters.
- An unsafe redirect target falls back to `/`.

### Outbound request defenses

- The webhook gate resolves the host at delivery time.
- The gate denies loopback when the loopback flag stays off.
- The gate denies private, link local, unique local, multicast, and reserved addresses.
- The gate unwraps IPv4 mapped IPv6 forms before classification.
- The client pins the checked address and never resolves again.
- The client follows no redirect.
- Delivery times out after 10 seconds.
- The client caps success bodies at 64 KiB.
- Mirror URL checks share the same host rules.
- The server refuses `file://` URLs unless the file URL flag allows them.
- GitHub import checks `github.api_url` against the same host rules.
- The GitHub API host must be HTTPS except on loopback hosts.
- The GitHub API host must resolve to an allowed address.

### Git push defenses

- The pre receive hook reads only the `STARFORGE_*` snapshot environment.
- The hook talks to no database.
- A missing or malformed `STARFORGE_PROTECTION` value fails closed for branches, tags, and namespaces.
- A malformed snapshot still allows `refs/for` pushes.
- An import in progress blocks every ref update.
- A pull mirror blocks branch, tag, and namespace updates.
- A pull mirror keeps `refs/for` open for discussion.
- Deploy keys and anonymous pushers cannot push `refs/for`.
- `refs/for` updates need read permission and a known base branch.
- The server refuses deletion of `refs/for` tips.
- Protected branches apply the gate rules in [git-hosting.md](git-hosting.md).
- Deploy keys push as `Write` without a user identity.
- Archived repositories refuse pushes.
- `limits.max_push_bytes` caps push input for HTTP and SSH pushes. Git receive pack runs with `receive.maxInputSize` at this value.
- `limits.max_repo_bytes` caps on disk size per repository. The pre receive hook measures the repository size plus the incoming objects. The hook refuses a push whole when the sum reaches the cap. The refusal text reads `starforge: repository size limit reached` with sizes in MiB. A measurement error logs a warning and allows the push.
- Pull mirrors and imports refuse to start a fetch once the repository reaches the limit. One fetch can still exceed the limit by its own size. Operators pair `max_repo_bytes` with `max_push_bytes` to bound a single push.
- `limits.git_per_ip_per_minute` caps git requests per address per 60 seconds. One HTTP clone, fetch, or push takes two or three requests. The requests include `info/refs` plus one or two pack requests. SSH counts each public key authentication attempt.
- Behind a reverse proxy every client shares the proxy address for this limit, as for the sign-in limiter. Operators prefer rate limiting at the proxy there.
- An HTTP breach answers 429 with `Retry-After` and a plain text body. The body reads `rate limit exceeded`.
- An SSH breach rejects the attempt before key lookup. The cap reduces key lookup abuse from one address.
- The daily prune deletes `audit_log` rows older than `audit.retention_days` days. A value of 0 keeps rows forever.
- Scheduled backups write to `backup.dir` every `backup.interval_hours` hours. Rotation keeps `backup.keep` backups. Rotation counts and deletes only `starforge-backup-*` directories. Rotation never deletes other entries or symlinks.

### Secrets handling

- The configuration value `security.secret_key` holds 64 hex characters.
- Loss of the value makes sealed webhook secrets, sealed mirror credentials, sealed CI secrets, and sealed authenticator secrets unreadable.
- Loss of the value does not by itself end a web session. Web sessions store only a hash of a random token.
- Recovery codes stay usable after key loss. Recovery codes rest as hash values, not as sealed values.
- Unreadable sealed values produce a clear error rather than a panic.
- The credential box seals git remote credentials through XChaCha20 Poly1305.
- The credential box derives its key from `security.secret_key`.
- The server seals webhook secrets and remote credentials at rest.
- Secrets never reach log output, rendered pages, command lines, or URLs.
- `Debug` output redacts the OIDC secret, metrics token, and mail credentials.
- The SSH host key file has mode 0600.
- The configuration file has mode 0600.
- Backup and restore directories have mode 0700. The initial data directory follows the process umask.
- The server deletes temporary SSH files after a failure.
- Git error text redacts user info before logging.
### CI runner and job authentication

- A runner token uses the `sfr_` prefix. A job token uses the `sfj_` prefix.
- The server stores a hash of each token and never stores the clear value.
- A revoked runner stops authenticating at once. The job claim dies with the runner.
- A live job token needs a claimed job and a live runner. Access loss revokes every live token of the job first.
- Finish and cancel revoke the job tokens and the git token. The secret shows once at mint time.
- Each claim mints one fence. The runner sends the fence in `X-Starforge-Fence` on each job route.
- A stale fence answers `409`. The lease deadline runs from claim time and expired leases lose the job.
- The git credential route mints one short lived git token per job. The token shows once and the server stores its hash.
- An artifact token uses the `sfa_` prefix. It allows one upload or download and expires in ten minutes.
- The runner scrubs known secret values from log chunks before trace upload. Scrub also covers the URL encoded form.

### CI secret handling

- The server seals CI secrets with XChaCha20 Poly1305 through `CiSecretBox`. The seal uses the `ci-secrets-v1` key.
- Secret views never carry sealed values or plaintexts. List routes show names only.
- Resolution returns values in memory for header injection at the egress proxy. The response sends `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- Each secret carries an optional `host` and an optional `header` binding. `host` defaults to empty. `header` defaults to `Authorization`. An empty host means no proxy injection.
- The server resolves a job sandbox create by itself. The server sends the bindings to the local daemon over the Unix socket. The daemon injects a value only when `secret_headers` names the same host and the same header.
- Secret values never enter the sandbox environment or filesystem on the local provider.
- Only the E2B provider delivers values as environment variables. The E2B path needs the repository opt-in `ci_env_secrets`.
- A `refs/for` run resolves no secrets by default. A repository admin can opt in with `ci_allow_secrets_on_refs_for`.
- The server resolves job secrets only when the reviewer's latest review of the job's own revision is an approval. An approval of an earlier revision does not carry over to a later revision.
- The egress proxy injects secret headers for allowlisted hosts only. The proxy injects a secret header only when the inner request `Host` matches the bound host. The proxy also checks the authority of an absolute form request. The proxy answers `403` for a mismatch. Unbound hosts receive no secret header. A `host:port` allowlist entry permits exactly one port.
- The proxy refuses special use addresses after DNS resolution. It refuses loopback, private, link local, CGNAT, multicast, reserved, and unique local addresses. It also refuses their IPv4 mapped forms. It refuses these addresses even for an allowlisted name or IP literal. The forge `host:port` and the operator ranges from the repeatable `--egress-allow-cidr` flag are the only exceptions.
- `create_sandbox_inner` refuses a caller-supplied `forge` value. Only the server sets it, on the job sandbox path.
- The proxy and its bindings redact values in `Debug` output. Values never reach logs, rendered pages, or URLs.

### Sandbox isolation

- The local provider shells out to rootless podman through the sandbox daemon. The daemon never runs as root.
- gVisor runs through `runsc` as an opt in runtime. The runtime table reports gVisor availability.
- The `e2b` provider talks to a remote cloud through the E2B shaped API. The adapter sends the API key on each call.
- The provider seam keeps isolation inside the provider. Core enforces policy, quotas, and ownership around it.
- File paths validate in Core before the provider runs. Absolute paths and `..` escapes fail validation.
- A per sandbox egress proxy meters socket traffic. The proxy trusts one CA per sandbox.
- The proxy enforces a host allowlist. Non HTTP ports need CIDR allowlisted addresses.
- The proxy refuses special use addresses after DNS resolution. The proxy refuses loopback, private, link local, CGNAT, multicast, reserved, and unique local addresses. The proxy also refuses IPv4 mapped forms of these addresses. The proxy refuses these addresses even for an allowlisted name or IP literal.
- The proxy allows two exceptions. The forge `host:port` from the server per job sandbox is the first exception. Operator ranges from the repeatable `--egress-allow-cidr CIDR` flag form the second exception.
- A repository secret bound to an internal host needs the host range in `--egress-allow-cidr`. The forge `host:port` entry lets a job reach the whole forge service on that port, on any path. A job holds no forge credential after checkout.
- File API reads follow symlinks inside the container only. The server refuses a path that escapes `/workspace`. A racing job reads at most files of its own container. A racing job reads no host files.
- The sandbox trusts the per sandbox CA. The CA keys rest in a directory with mode `0600`.
- The sandbox keeps `--network none`. The daemon mounts a per sandbox egress directory and starts an in sandbox forwarder. The forwarder listens on `127.0.0.1:3128` and creates a Unix socket in that directory. The host daemon connects into the socket with a connection pool. SELinux denies the reverse direction. The sandbox has no other network route, so host loopback is not reachable.
- The proxy forwards HTTPS `CONNECT` and absolute form plain HTTP to allowlisted hosts. A bare `host` entry permits ports 80 and 443 only. A `host:port` entry permits exactly that port. The daemon can add a private HTTPS port with `--egress-https-port`.
- The forwarder socket exists only inside its sandbox. A sibling sandbox cannot reach it. The daemon copies its own binary into the sandbox, so the daemon must be a static binary.
- The proxy enforces the allowlist for proxied traffic. Secret values never enter the sandbox.

### CI and sandbox abuse controls

- Sandbox limits cap concurrent sandboxes per user and per repository. A time limit caps sandbox seconds per user per hour.
- The limits default to zero, which disables each limit. Refusals answer `429`.
- Native CI limits cap runner minutes per calendar month and artifact bytes per repository. Zero disables each limit.
- An exhausted minutes month refuses the run and records the reason on its check. Refusals answer `422` with code `invalid`.
- An artifact quota check runs before each upload authorization. Oversize artifacts fail the size cap check.
- Depot usage comes from Depot and Depot enforces its own limits. Starforge never blocks Depot work.

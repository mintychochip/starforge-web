# Glossary

## Purpose

This page defines each approved term and the code name for that term. A writer uses the approved term and never the synonym. A reviewer uses this page to reject a synonym in review. A developer uses the code column to find the type, table, or function for the term.

## Scope

The table defines words that appear in code, in the database schema, and in the user interface. A row gives one short definition and the exact code location. A row also links to the page that uses the term most. Prose in the other pages follows the same terms.

### Rules for correct use

Sentences in the other pages use the terms in the tables. A writer adds a new term to this glossary or to the project dictionary in [ste100.md](ste100.md). The writer does this before the term appears in prose. A reviewer checks a new term against the dictionary and the code column. A row changes in the same commit as the code change. See the [maintenance page](maintenance.md) for the change procedure.

### Usage notes

The dictionary splits session and web session.
A session is one agent conversation that the CLI captures.
A web session is one browser sign-in record. The code keeps the split
in table names `sessions` and `web_sessions`.

The dictionary splits check and status.
Prose uses check for the commit status concept. The API resource names
`/statuses`, `StatusDto`, `submit_status`, and `combined_status` stay in code form.

The dictionary splits owner and uploader.
An owner is a user or an org in the handle namespace. An uploader is
the user who uploaded a session. Code keeps the split in `owners` and
`sessions.uploader_id`.

### Rejected synonyms

The table lists common synonyms and the approved term for each one.
The project dictionary in [ste100.md](ste100.md) is authoritative, and this table is a subset.
Code names, CLI paths, and native agent files keep their spelling. A writer replaces a synonym only when it names the same concept.

| Rejected word | Approved term |
|---|---|
| `repo` | repository |
| `version` | revision |
| `comment` | review |
| `comment thread` | thread |
| `rule` | gate rule |
| `log in` | sign in |
| `boot` | start |
| `set up` | configure |
| `since` | because |
| `may`, `might` | can |
| `should`, `shall` | must |
| `e.g.` | for example |
| `i.e.` | that is |
| `leverage` | use |
| `login page` | sign-in page |
| `username` | handle |
| `PR` | change |
| `transcript` for a trace | trace |
| `chunk` | segment |
| `collect` | capture |
| `connector` | adapter |
| `scrub` for trace secrets | redact |
| `isolate` | quarantine |
| `share` | publish |
| `remove data` | delete or purge |
| `API key` | token |

## Verification

Execute each step and confirm the expected result.

- Run `python3 scripts/ste_check.py docs/technical/glossary.md`.
- Confirm the checker reports 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- Confirm each code name in the tables matches the source files.
- Confirm each link in the tables points at an existing page.
- Confirm a new term appears in `ste100.md` before prose uses the term.
